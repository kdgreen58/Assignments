# plot(XI, YI, main = "Data Set I", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
# plot(XII, YII, main = "Data Set II", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
# plot(XIII, YIII, main = "Data Set III", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
# plot(XIV, YIV, main = "Data Set IV", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
#
# This plots four scatterplots all on the same view. 
#
# Data set one looks like a completely random data set where if a regression line was 
# drawn through it not all points will be on the line but no more than one 
# standard deviation away.
#
# Data set two looks like a hyperbolic trend of data points peaking at ~x = 11.
#
# Data set three looks like an almost perfect trend like, but with one outlier, ~x= 13.
#
# Data set four is just a vertical line on x=8.
